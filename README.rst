Invoke is a Python (2.6+) task execution and management tool. It's similar to
pre-existing tools in other languages (such as Make or Rake) but lets you
interface easily with Python codebases, and of course write your tasks
themselves in straight-up Python.

For documentation, including detailed installation information, please see
http://docs.pyinvoke.org. Post-install usage information may be found in ``invoke
--help``.

You can install the `development version
<https://github.com/pyinvoke/invoke/tarball/master#egg=invoke-dev>`_ via ``pip
install invoke==dev``.
