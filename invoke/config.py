class Config(DataProxy):
    """
    Invoke's primary configuration handling class.

    See :doc:`/concepts/configuration` for details on the configuration system
    this class implements, including the :ref:`configuration hierarchy
    <config-hierarchy>`. The rest of this class' documentation assumes
    familiarity with that document.

    **Access**

    Configuration values may be accessed and/or updated using dict syntax::

        config['foo']

    or attribute syntax::

        config.foo

    Nesting works the same way - dict config values are turned into objects
    which honor both the dictionary protocol and the attribute-access method::

       config['foo']['bar']
       config.foo.bar

    **A note about attribute access and methods**

    This class implements the entire dictionary protocol: methods such as
    ``keys``, ``values``, ``items``, ``pop`` and so forth should all function
    as they do on regular dicts. It also implements new config-specific methods
    such as `load_system`, `load_collection`, `merge`, `clone`, etc.

    .. warning::
        Accordingly, this means that if you have configuration options sharing
        names with these methods, you **must** use dictionary syntax (e.g.
        ``myconfig['keys']``) to access the configuration data.

    **Lifecycle**

    At initialization time, `.Config`:

    - creates per-level data structures;
    - stores any levels supplied to `__init__`, such as defaults or overrides,
      as well as the various config file paths/filename patterns;
    - and loads config files, if found (though typically this just means system
      and user-level files, as project and runtime files need more info before
      they can be found and loaded.)

        - This step can be skipped by specifying ``lazy=True``.

    At this point, `.Config` is fully usable - and because it pre-emptively
    loads some config files, those config files can affect anything that
    comes after, like CLI parsing or loading of task collections.

    In the CLI use case, further processing is done after instantiation, using
    the ``load_*`` methods such as `load_overrides`, `load_project`, etc:

    - the result of argument/option parsing is applied to the overrides level;
    - a project-level config file is loaded, as it's dependent on a loaded
      tasks collection;
    - a runtime config file is loaded, if its flag was supplied;
    - then, for each task being executed:

        - per-collection data is loaded (only possible now that we have
          collection & task in hand);
        - shell environment data is loaded (must be done at end of process due
          to using the rest of the config as a guide for interpreting env var
          names.)

    At this point, the config object is handed to the task being executed, as
    part of its execution `.Context`.

    Any modifications made directly to the `.Config` itself after this point
    end up stored in their own (topmost) config level, making it easier to
    debug final values.

    Finally, any *deletions* made to the `.Config` (e.g. applications of
    dict-style mutators like ``pop``, ``clear`` etc) are also tracked in their
    own structure, allowing the config object to honor such method calls
    without mutating the underlying source data.

    **Special class attributes**

    The following class-level attributes are used for low-level configuration
    of the config system itself, such as which file paths to load. They are
    primarily intended for overriding by subclasses.

    - ``prefix``: Supplies the default value for ``file_prefix`` (directly) and
      ``env_prefix`` (uppercased). See their descriptions for details. Its
      default value is ``"invoke"``.
    - ``file_prefix``: The config file 'basename' default (though it is not a
      literal basename; it can contain path parts if desired) which is appended
      to the configured values of ``system_prefix``, ``user_prefix``, etc, to
      arrive at the final (pre-extension) file paths.

      Thus, by default, a system-level config file path concatenates the
      ``system_prefix`` of ``/etc/`` with the ``file_prefix`` of ``invoke`` to
      arrive at paths like ``/etc/invoke.json``.

      Defaults to ``None``, meaning to use the value of ``prefix``.

    - ``env_prefix``: A prefix used (along with a joining underscore) to
      determine which environment variables are loaded as the env var
      configuration level. Since its default is the value of ``prefix``
      capitalized, this means env vars like ``INVOKE_RUN_ECHO`` are sought by
      default.

      Defaults to ``None``, meaning to use the value of ``prefix``.

            may contain partial file paths; for the per-user config file this
            often means a leading dot, to make the final result a hidden file
            on most systems.

            Default: ``~/.`` (e.g. ``~/.invoke.yaml``).

        :param str project_location:
            Optional directory path of the currently loaded `.Collection` (as
            loaded by `.Loader`). When non-empty, will trigger seeking of
            per-project config files in this directory.

        :param str runtime_path:
            Optional file path to a runtime configuration file.

            Used to fill the penultimate slot in the config hierarchy. Should
            be a full file path to an existing file, not a directory path or a
            prefix.

        :param bool lazy:
            Whether to automatically load some of the lower config levels.

            By default (``lazy=False``), ``__init__`` automatically calls
            `load_system` and `load_user` to load system and user config files,
            respectively.

            For more control over what is loaded when, you can say
            ``lazy=True``, and no automatic loading is done.

            .. note::
                If you give ``defaults`` and/or ``overrides`` as ``__init__``
                kwargs instead of waiting to use `load_defaults` or
                `load_overrides` afterwards, those *will* still end up 'loaded'
                immediately.
