    Execute ``command`` (via ``runner``) returning a `Result` object.

    A `.Failure` exception (containing a reference to the `Result` that would
    otherwise have been returned) is raised if the command terminates with a
    nonzero return code. This behavior may be disabled by setting
    ``warn=True``.

    To disable copying the command's stdout and/or stderr to the controlling
    terminal, specify ``hide='out'`` (or ``'stdout'``), ``hide='err'`` (or
    ``'stderr'``) or ``hide='both'`` (or ``True``). The default value is
    ``None``, meaning to print everything; ``False`` will also disable hiding.

    .. note::
        Stdout and stderr are always captured and stored in the ``Result``
        object, regardless of ``hide``'s value.

    By default, ``run`` connects directly to the invoked process and reads
    its stdout/stderr streams. Some programs will buffer differently (or even
    behave differently) in this situation compared to using an actual terminal
    or pty. To use a pty, specify ``pty=True``.

    .. warning::
        Due to their nature, ptys have a single output stream, so the ability
        to tell stdout apart from stderr is **not possible** when ``pty=True``.
        As such, all output will appear on your local stdout and be captured
        into the ``stdout`` result attribute. Stderr and ``stderr`` will always
        be empty when ``pty=True``.

    `.run` does not echo the commands it runs by default; to make it do so, say
    ``echo=True``.

    The ``runner`` argument allows overriding the actual execution mechanism,
    and must be a class exposing two methods, ``run`` and ``run_pty``, whose
    signatures must match ``function(command, warn, hide)`` - all of which
    match the above descriptions, re: types and default values.
    
    These methods must return a tuple of ``(stdout, stderr, exited,
    exception)``, where ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` are strings, ``exited`` is
    an integer, and ``exception`` is an exception object or ``None``.

    The subprocess output is assumed to use encoding ``encoding`` (which
    defaults to ``locale.getpreferredencoding(False)``).
