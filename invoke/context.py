    Context-aware API wrapper & state-passing object.

    `.Context` objects are created during command-line parsing (or, if desired,
    by hand) and used to share parser and configuration state with executed
    tasks (see :doc:`/concepts/context`).

    Specifically, the class offers wrappers for core API calls (such as `.run`)
    which take into account CLI parser flags, configuration files, and/or
    changes made at runtime. It also acts as a proxy for its `~.Context.config`
    attribute - see that attribute's documentation for details.

    Instances of `.Context` may be shared between tasks when executing
    sub-tasks - either the same context the caller was given, or an altered
    copy thereof (or, theoretically, a brand new one).
