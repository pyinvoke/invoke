        Execute one or more ``tasks`` in sequence.

        :param tasks:
            An iterable of two-tuples whose first element is a task name and
            whose second element is a dict suitable for use as ``**kwargs``.
            E.g.::

                [
                    ('task1', {}),
                    ('task2', {'arg1': 'val1'}),

            As a shorthand, a string instead of a two-tuple may be given,
            implying an empty kwargs dict.

            The string specifies which task from the Executor's `.Collection`
            is to be executed. It may contain dotted syntax appropriate for
            calling namespaced tasks, e.g. ``subcollection.taskname``.

            Thus the above list-of-tuples is roughly equivalent to::

                task1()
                task2(arg1='val1')

        :returns:
            A dict mapping task objects to their return values. This may
            include pre- and post-tasks if any were executed.
