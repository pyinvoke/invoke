        Execute one or more ``tasks`` in sequence.

        :param tasks:
            An all-purpose iterable of "tasks to execute", each member of which
            may take one of the following forms:

            **A string** naming a task from the Executor's `.Collection`. This
            name may contain dotted syntax appropriate for calling namespaced
            tasks, e.g. ``subcollection.taskname``. Such tasks are executed
            without arguments.

            **A two-tuple** whose first element is a task name string (as
            above) and whose second element is a dict suitable for use as
            ``**kwargs`` when calling the named task. E.g.::

                [
                    ('task1', {}),
                    ('task2', {'arg1': 'val1'}),
                    ...
                ]

            is equivalent, roughly, to::

                task1()
                task2(arg1='val1')

            **A `.ParserContext`** instance, whose ``.name`` attribute is used
            as the task name and whose ``.as_kwargs`` attribute is used as the
            task kwargs (again following the above specifications).

            .. note::
                When called without any arguments at all (i.e. when ``*tasks``
                is empty), the default task from ``self.collection`` is used
                instead, if defined.

        :returns:
            A dict mapping task objects to their return values.

            This dict may include pre- and post-tasks if any were executed. For
            example, in a collection with a ``build`` task depending on another
            task named ``setup``, executing ``build`` will result in a dict
            with two keys, one for ``build`` and one for ``setup``.
