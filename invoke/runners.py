        Execute ``command``, returning an instance of `Result`.

        .. note::
            All kwargs will default to the values found in this instance's
            `~.Runner.context` attribute, specifically in its configuration's
            ``run`` subtree (e.g. ``run.echo`` provides the default value for
            the ``echo`` keyword, etc). The base default values are described
            in the parameter list below.

        :param str command: The shell command to execute.

        :param bool warn:
            Whether to warn and continue, instead of raising `.Failure`, when
            the executed command exits with a nonzero status. Default:
            ``False``.

        :param hide:
            Allows the caller to disable ``run``'s default behavior of copying
            the subprocess' stdout and stderr to the controlling terminal.
            Specify ``hide='out'`` (or ``'stdout'``) to hide only the stdout
            stream, ``hide='err'`` (or ``'stderr'``) to hide only stderr, or
            ``hide='both'`` (or ``True``) to hide both streams.

            The default value is ``None``, meaning to print everything;
            ``False`` will also disable hiding.

            .. note::
                Stdout and stderr are always captured and stored in the
                ``Result`` object, regardless of ``hide``'s value.

            .. note::
                ``hide=True`` will also override ``echo=True`` if both are
                given (either as kwargs or via config/CLI).

        :param bool pty:
            By default, ``run`` connects directly to the invoked process and
            reads its stdout/stderr streams. Some programs will buffer (or even
            behave) differently in this situation compared to using an actual
            terminal or pty. To use a pty, specify ``pty=True``.

            .. warning::
                Due to their nature, ptys have a single output stream, so the
                ability to tell stdout apart from stderr is **not possible**
                when ``pty=True``. As such, all output will appear on
                ``out_stream`` (see below) and be captured into the ``stdout``
                result attribute. ``err_stream`` and ``stderr`` will always be
                empty when ``pty=True``.

        :param bool fallback:
            Controls auto-fallback behavior re: problems offering a pty when
            ``pty=True``. Whether this has any effect depends on the specific
            `Runner` subclass being invoked. Default: ``True``.

        :param bool echo:
            Controls whether `.run` prints the command string to local stdout
            prior to executing it. Default: ``False``.

            .. note::
                ``hide=True`` will override ``echo=True`` if both are given.

        :param str encoding:
            Override auto-detection of which encoding the subprocess is using
            for its stdout/stderr streams (which defaults to the return value
            of `default_encoding`).

        :param out_stream:
            A file-like stream object to which the subprocess' standard error
            should be written. If ``None`` (the default), ``sys.stdout`` will
            be used.

        :param err_stream:
            Same as ``out_stream``, except for standard error, and defaulting
            to ``sys.stderr``.

        :param in_stream:
            A file-like stream object to used as the subprocess' standard
            input. If ``None`` (the default), ``sys.stdin`` will be used.

        :param dict responses:
            A `dict` whose keys are regular expressions to be searched for in
            the program's ``stdout`` or ``stderr``, and whose values may be any
            value one desires to write into a stdin text/binary stream
            (typically ``str`` or ``bytes`` objects depending on Python
            version) in response.

            See :doc:`/concepts/responses` for details on this functionality.

            Default: ``{}``.

        :returns:
            `Result`, or a subclass thereof.

        :raises: `.Failure` (if the command exited nonzero & ``warn=False``)
