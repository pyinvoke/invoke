* :bug:`390` Fallback importing of a modules from sys.path. This has been
  fixed, thanks to Paul Healy.
* :bug:`430` Fallback importing of PyYAML when Invoke has been installed
  without its vendor directory, was still trying to import the vendorized
  module names (e.g. ``yaml2`` or ``yaml3`` instead of simply ``yaml``). This
  has been fixed, thanks to Athmane Madjoudj.
* :release:`0.15.0 <2017-02-14>`
* :bug:`426 major` `DataProxy <invoke.config.DataProxy>` based classes like
  `Config <invoke.config.Config>` and `Context <invoke.context.Context>` didn't
  like being `pickled <pickle>` or `copied <copy.copy>` and threw
  ``RecursionError``. This has been fixed.
* :feature:`-` `Config <invoke.config.Config>`'s internals got cleaned up
  somewhat; end users should not see much of a difference, but advanced
  users or authors of extension code may notice the following:

  - Direct modification of config data (e.g. ``myconfig.section.subsection.key
    = 'value'`` in user/task code) is now stored in its own config 'level'/data
    structure; previously such modifications simply mutated the central,
    'merged' config cache. This makes it much easier to determine where a final
    observed value came from, and prevents accidental data loss.
  - Ditto for deleted values.
  - Merging/reconciliation of the config levels now happens automatically when
    data is loaded or modified, which not only simplifies the object's
    lifecycle a bit but allows the previous change to function without
    requiring users to call ``.merge()`` after every modification.

* :bug:`- major` Python 3's hashing rules differ from Python 2, specifically:

    A class that overrides ``__eq__()`` and does not define ``__hash__()`` will
    have its ``__hash__()`` implicitly set to None.

  `Config <invoke.config.Config>` (specifically, its foundational class
  `DataProxy <invoke.config.DataProxy>`) only defined ``__eq__`` which,
  combined with the above behavior, meant that ``Config`` objects appeared to
  hash successfully on Python 2 but yielded ``TypeErrors`` on Python 3.

  This has been fixed by explicitly setting ``__hash__ = None`` so that the
  objects do not hash on either interpreter (there are no good immutable
  attributes by which to define hashability).
* :bug:`- major` Configuration keys named ``config`` were inadvertently
  exposing the internal dict representation of the containing config object,
  instead of displaying the actual value stored in that key. (Thus, a set
  config of ``mycontext.foo.bar.config`` would act as if it was the key/value
  contents of the ``mycontext.foo.bar`` subtree.) This has been fixed.
* :feature:`421` Updated `Config.clone <invoke.config.Config.clone>` (and a few
  other related areas) to replace use of `copy.deepcopy` with a less-rigorous
  but also less-likely-to-explode recursive dict copier. This prevents
  frustrating ``TypeErrors`` while still preserving barriers between different
  tasks' configuration values.
* :feature:`-` `Config.clone <invoke.config.Config.clone>` grew a new ``into``
  kwarg allowing client libraries with their own `~invoke.config.Config`
  subclasses to easily "upgrade" vanilla Invoke config objects into their local
  variety.
* :bug:`419 major` Optional parser arguments had a few issues:

  - The :ref:`conceptual docs about CLI parsing <optional-values>` mentioned
    them, but didn't actually show via example how to enable the feature,
    implying (incorrectly) that they were active always by default. An example
    has been added.
  - Even when enabled, they did not function correctly when their default
    values were of type ``bool``; in this situation, trying to give a value (vs
    just giving the flag name by itself) caused a parser error.  This has been
    fixed.

  Thanks to ``@ouroboroscoding`` for the report.
* :support:`204` (via :issue:`412`) Fall back to globally-installed copies of
  our vendored dependencies, if the import from the ``vendor`` tree fails. In
  normal situations this won't happen, but it allows advanced users or
  downstream maintainers to nuke ``vendor/`` and prefer explicitly installed
  packages of e.g. ``six``, ``pyyaml`` or ``fluidity``. Thanks to Athmane
  Madjoudj for the patch.
* :bug:`- major` Fix configuration framework such that nested or dict-like
  config values may be compared with regular dicts. Previously, doing so caused
  an ``AttributeError`` (as regular dicts lack a ``.config``).
* :bug:`413 major` Update behavior of ``DataProxy`` (used within
  `~invoke.context.Context` and `~invoke.config.Config`) again, fixing two
  related issues:

  - Creating new configuration keys via attribute access wasn't possible: one
    had to do ``config['foo'] = 'bar'`` because ``config.foo = 'bar'`` would
    set a real attribute instead of touching configuration.
  - Supertypes' attributes weren't being considered during the "is this a real
    attribute on ``self``?" test, leading to different behavior between a
    nested config-value-as-attribute and a top-level Context/Config one.

* :release:`0.14.0 <2016-12-05>`
* :bug:`349 major` Display the string representation of
  `~invoke.exceptions.UnexpectedExit` when handling it inside of
  `~invoke.program.Program` (including regular ``inv``), if any output was
  hidden during the ``run`` that generated it.

  Previously, we only exited with the exception's stored exit code, meaning
  failures of ``run(..., hide=True)`` commands were unexpectedly silent.
  (Library-style use of the codebase didn't have this problem, since tracebacks
  aren't muted.)

  While implementing this change, we also tweaked the overall display of
  ``UnexpectedExit`` so it's a bit more consistent & useful:

  - noting "hey, you ran with ``pty=True``, so there's no stderr";
  - showing only the last 10 lines of captured output in the error message
    (users can, of course, always manually handle the error & access the full
    thing if desired);
  - only showing a given stream when it was not already printed to the user's
    terminal (i.e. if ``hide=False``, no captured output is shown in the error
    text; if ``hide='stdout'``, only stdout is shown in the error text; etc.)

  Thanks to Patrick Massot for the original bug report.

* :feature:`-` Expose the (normalized) value of `~invoke.runners.Runner.run`'s
  ``hide`` parameter in its return-value `~invoke.runners.Result` objects.
* :bug:`288 major` Address a bug preventing reuse of Invoke as a custom
  binstub, by moving ``--list`` into the "core args" set of flags present on
  all Invoke-derived binstubs. Thanks to Jordon Mears for catch & patch.
* :bug:`283 major` Fix the concepts/library docs so the example of an explicit
  ``namespace=`` argument correctly shows wrapping an imported task module in a
  `~invoke.collection.Collection`. Thanks to ``@zaiste`` for the report.
* :bug:`- major` Fix ``DataProxy`` (used within `~invoke.context.Context` and
  `~invoke.config.Config`) so that real attributes and methods which are
  shadowed by configuration keys, aren't proxied to the config during regular
  attribute get/set. (Such config keys are thus required to be accessed via
  dict-style only, or (on `~invoke.context.Context`) via the explicit
  ``.config`` attribute.)
* :bug:`58 major` Work around bugs in ``select()`` when handling subprocess
  stream reads, which was causing poor behavior in many nontrivial interactive
  programs (such as ``vim`` and other fullscreen editors, ``python`` and other
  REPLs/shells, etc). Such programs should now be largely indistinguishable
  from their behavior when run directly from a user's shell.
* :feature:`406` Update handling of Ctrl-C/``KeyboardInterrupt``, and
  subprocess exit status pass-through, to be more correct than before:

  - Submit the interrupt byte sequence ``\x03`` to stdin of all subprocesses,
    instead of sending ``SIGINT``.

      - This results in behavior closer to that of truly pressing Ctrl-C when
        running subprocesses directly; for example, interactive programs like
        ``vim`` or ``python`` now behave normally instead of prematurely
        exiting.
      - Of course, programs that would normally exit on Ctrl-C will still do
        so!

  - The exit statuses of subprocesses run with ``pty=True`` are more rigorously
    checked (using `os.WIFEXITED` and friends), allowing us to surface the real
    exit values of interrupted programs instead of manually assuming exit code
    ``130``.

      - Typically, this will be exit code ``-2``, but it is system dependent.
      - Other, non-Ctrl-C-driven signal-related exits under PTYs should behave
        better now as well - previously they could appear to exit ``0``!

  - Non-subprocess-related ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (i.e. those generated when
    running top level Python code outside of any ``run`` function calls)
    will now trigger exit code ``1``, as that is how the Python interpreter
    typically behaves if you ``KeyboardInterrupt`` it outside of a live
    REPL.

  .. warning::
    These changes are **backwards incompatible** if you were relying on the
    "exits ``130``" behavior added in version 0.13, or on the (incorrect)
    ``SIGINT`` method of killing pty-driven subprocesses on Ctrl-C.

* :bug:`- major` Correctly raise ``TypeError`` when unexpected keyword
  arguments are given to `~invoke.runners.Runner.run`.
* :feature:`-` Add a `~invoke.context.MockContext` class for easier testing of
  user-written tasks and related client code. Includes adding a
  :ref:`conceptual document on how to test Invoke-using code
  <testing-user-code>`.
* :feature:`-` Update implementation of `~invoke.runners.Result` so it has
  default values for all parameters/attributes. This allows it to be more
  easily used when mocking ``run`` calls in client libraries' tests.

  .. warning::
    This is a backwards incompatible change if you are manually instantiating
    `~invoke.runners.Result` objects with positional arguments: positional
    argument order has changed. (Compare the API docs between versions to see
    exactly how.)

* :feature:`294` Implement `Context.sudo <invoke.context.Context.sudo>`, which
  wraps `~invoke.context.Context.run` inside a ``sudo`` command. It is capable
  of auto-responding to ``sudo``'s password prompt with a configured password,
  and raises a specific exception (`~invoke.exceptions.AuthFailure`) if that
  password is rejected.
* :feature:`369` Overhaul the autoresponse functionality for `~invoke.run` so
  it's significantly more extensible, both for its own sake and as part of
  implementing :issue:`294` (see its own changelog entry for details).

  .. warning::
      This is a backwards incompatible change: the ``responses`` kwarg to
      ``run()`` is now ``watchers``, and accepts a list of
      `~invoke.watchers.StreamWatcher` objects (such as
      `~invoke.watchers.Responder`) instead of a dict.

      If you were using ``run(..., responses={'pattern': 'response'}``
      previously, just update to instead use ``run(...,
      watchers=[Responder('pattern', 'response')])``.

* :bug:`- major` Fix a bug in `Config.clone <invoke.config.Config.clone>` where
  it was instantiating a new ``Config`` instead of a member of the subclass.
* :release:`0.13.0 <2016-06-09>`
* :feature:`114` Ripped off the band-aid and removed non-contextualized tasks
  as an option; all tasks must now be contextualized (defined as ``def
  mytask(context, ...)`` - see :ref:`defining-and-running-task-functions`) even
  if not using the context. This simplifies the implementation as well as
  users' conceptual models. Thanks to Bay Grabowski for the patch.

  .. warning:: This is a backwards incompatible change!

* :bug:`350 major` (also :issue:`274`, :issue:`241`, :issue:`262`,
  :issue:`242`, :issue:`321`, :issue:`338`) Clean up and reorganize
  encoding-related parts of the code to avoid some of the more common or
  egregious encode/decode errors surrounding clearly non-ASCII-compatible text.
  Bug reports, assistance, feedback and code examples courtesy of Paul Moore,
  Vlad Frolov, Christian Aichinger, Fotis Gimian, Daniel Nunes, and others.
* :bug:`351 major` Protect against ``run`` deadlocks involving exceptions in
  I/O threads & nontrivial amounts of unread data in the corresponding
  subprocess pipe(s). This situation should now always result in exceptions
  instead of hangs.
* :feature:`259` (also :issue:`280`) Allow updating (or replacing) subprocess
  shell environments, via the ``env`` and ``replace_env`` kwargs to
  `~invoke.runners.Runner.run`. Thanks to Fotis Gimian for the report,
  ``@philtay`` for an early version of the final patch, and Erich Heine & Vlad
  Frolov for feedback.
* :feature:`67` Added ``shell`` option to `~invoke.runners.Runner.run`,
  allowing control of the shell used when invoking commands. Previously,
  ``pty=True`` used ``/bin/bash`` and ``pty=False`` (the default) used
  ``/bin/sh``; the new unified default value is ``/bin/bash``.

  Thanks to Jochen Breuer for the report.
* :bug:`152 major` (also :issue:`251`, :issue:`331`) Correctly handle
  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` during `~invoke.runners.Runner.run`, re: both mirroring
  the interrupt signal to the subprocess *and* capturing the local exception
  within Invoke's CLI handler (so there's no messy traceback, just exiting with
  code ``130``).

  Thanks to Peter Darrow for the report, and to Mika Eloranta & Máté Farkas for
  early versions of the patchset.
* :support:`319` Fixed an issue resulting from :issue:`255` which
  caused problems with how we generate release wheels (notably, some releases
  such as 0.12.1 fail when installing from wheels on Python 2).

  .. note::
    As part of this fix, the next release will distribute individual Python 2
    and Python 3 wheels instead of one 'universal' wheel. This change should be
    transparent to users.

  Thanks to ``@ojos`` for the initial report and Frazer McLean for some
  particularly useful feedback.
* :release:`0.12.2 <2016-02-07>`
* :support:`314 backported` (Partial fix.) Update ``MANIFEST.in`` so source
  distributions include some missing project-management files (e.g. our
  internal ``tasks.py``). This makes unpacked sdists more useful for things
  like running the doc or build tasks.
* :bug:`303` Make sure `~invoke.run` waits for its IO worker threads to cleanly
  exit (such as allowing a ``finally`` block to revert TTY settings) when
  ``KeyboardInterrupt`` (or similar) aborts execution in the main thread.
  Thanks to Tony S Yu and Máté Farkas for the report.
* :release:`0.12.1 <2016-02-03>`
* :bug:`308` Earlier changes to TTY detection & its use in determining features
  such as stdin pass-through, were insufficient to handle edge cases such as
  nested Invoke sessions or piped stdin to Invoke processes. This manifested as
  hangs and ``OSError`` messages about broken pipes.

  The issue has been fixed by overhauling all related code to use more specific
  and accurate checks (e.g. examining just ``fileno`` and/or just ``isatty``).

  Thanks to Tuukka Mustonen and Máté Farkas for the report (and for enduring
  the subsequent flood of the project maintainer's stream-of-consciousness
  ticket updates).
* :bug:`305` (also :issue:`306`) Fix up some test-suite issues causing failures
  on Windows/Appveyor. Thanks to Paul Moore.
* :bug:`289` Handful of issues, all fallout from :issue:`289`, which failed to
  make it out the door for 0.12.0. More are on the way but these should address
  blockers for some users:

    * Windows support for the new stdin replication functionality (this was
      totally blocking Windows users, as reported in :issue:`302` - sorry!);
    * Stdin is now mirrored to stdout when no PTY is present, so you can see
      what you're typing (plus a new `~invoke.runners.Runner.run` option and
      config param, ``echo_stdin``, allowing user override of this behavior);
    * Exposed the stdin read loop's sleep time as `Runner.input_sleep
      <invoke.runners.Runner.input_sleep>`;
    * Sped up some tests a bit.

* :release:`0.12.0 <2016-01-12>`
* :bug:`257 major` Fix a RecursionError under Python 3 due to lack of
  ``__deepcopy__`` on `~invoke.tasks.Call` objects. Thanks to Markus
  Zapke-Gründemann for initial report and Máté Farkas for the patch.
* :support:`265` Update our Travis config to select its newer build
  infrastructure and also run on PyPy3. Thanks to Omer Katz.
* :support:`254` Add an ``exclude`` option in our ``setup.py`` so setuptools
  doesn't try loading our vendored PyYAML's Python 2 sub-package under Python 3
  (or vice versa - though all reports were from Python 3 users). Thanks to
  ``@yoshiya0503`` for catch & initial patch.
* :feature:`68` Disable Python's bytecode caching by default, as it complicates
  our typical use case (frequently-changing .py files) and offers little
  benefit for human-facing startup times. Bytecode caching can be explicitly
  re-enabled by specifying ``--write-pyc`` at runtime. Thanks to Jochen Breuer
  for feature request and ``@brutus`` for initial patchset.
* :support:`144` Add code-coverage reporting to our CI builds (albeit `CodeCov
  <https://codecov.io>`_ instead of `coveralls.io <https://coveralls.io>`_).
  Includes rejiggering our project-specific coverage-generating tasks. Thanks
  to David Baumgold for the original request/PR and to Justin Abrahms for the
  tipoff re: CodeCov.
* :bug:`297 major` Ignore leading and trailing underscores when turning task
  arguments into CLI flag names.
* :bug:`296 major` Don't mutate ``sys.path`` on collection load if task's
  parent directory is already on ``sys.path``.
* :bug:`295 major` Make sure that `~invoke.run`'s ``hide=True`` also disables
  echoing. Otherwise, "hidden" helper ``run`` calls will still pollute output
  when run as e.g. ``invoke --echo ...``.
* :feature:`289` (also :issue:`263`) Implement :ref:`autoresponding
  <autoresponding>` for `~invoke.run`.
* :support:`-` Removed official Python 3.2 support; sibling projects also did
  this recently, it's simply not worth the annoyance given the userbase size.
* :feature:`228` (partial) Modified and expanded implementation of
  `~invoke.executor.Executor`, `~invoke.tasks.Task` and `~invoke.tasks.Call` to
  make implementing task parameterization easier.
* :support:`-` Removed the ``-H`` short flag, leaving just ``--hide``. This was
  done to avoid conflicts with Fabric's host-oriented ``-H`` flag. Favoritism
  is real! Apologies.

  .. warning:: This change is backwards compatible if you used ``-H``.

* :feature:`173` Overhauled top level CLI functionality to allow reusing
  Invoke for distinct binaries, optionally with bundled task namespaces as
  subcommands. As a side effect, this functionality is now much more extensible
  to boot. Thanks to Erich Heine for feedback/suggestions during development.

  .. warning::
    This change is backwards incompatible if you imported anything from the
    ``invoke.cli`` module (which is now rearchitected as
    `~invoke.program.Program`). It should be transparent to everybody else.

  .. seealso:: :ref:`reusing-as-a-binary`

* :bug:`- major` Fixed a bug in the parser where ``invoke --takes-optional-arg
  avalue --anotherflag`` was incorrectly considering ``--anotherflag`` to be an
  ambiguity error (as if ``avalue`` had not been given to
  ``--takes-optional-arg``.
* :release:`0.11.1 <2015-09-07>`
* :support:`- backported` Fix incorrect changelog URL in package metadata.
* :release:`0.11.0 <2015-09-07>`
* :feature:`-` Add a ``.command`` attribute to `~invoke.runners.Result` to
  preserve the command executed for post-execution introspection.
* :feature:`-` Detect local controlling terminal size
  (`~invoke.platform.pty_size`) and apply that information when creating
  pseudoterminals in `~invoke.run` when ``pty=True``.
* :bug:`- major` Display stdout instead of stderr in the ``repr()`` of
  `~invoke.exceptions.Failure` objects, when a pseudo-terminal was used.
  Previously, failure display focused on the stderr stream, which is always
  empty under pseudo-terminals.
* :bug:`- major` Correctly handle situations where `sys.stdin` has been
  replaced with an object lacking ``.fileno`` (e.g., some advanced Python
  shells, headless code execution tools, etc). Previously, this situation
  resulted in an ``AttributeError``.
* :bug:`- major` Capture & reraise exceptions generated by command execution I/O
  threads, in the main thread, as a `~invoke.exceptions.ThreadException`.
* :feature:`235` Allow custom stream objects to be used in `~invoke.run` calls,
  to be used instead of the defaults of ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr``.

  .. warning::
    This change required a major cleanup/rearchitecture of the command
    execution implementation. The vendored ``pexpect`` module has been
    completely removed and the API of the `~invoke.runners.Runner` class has
    changed dramatically (though **the API for run() itself has not**).

    Be aware there may be edge-case terminal behaviors which have changed or
    broken as a result of removing ``pexpect``. Please report these as bugs! We
    expect to crib small bits of what ``pexpect`` does but need concrete test
    cases first.

* :bug:`234 major` (also :issue:`243`) Preserve task-module load location when
  creating explicit collections with
  `~invoke.collection.Collection.from_module`; when this was not done,
  project-local config files were not loading correctly. Thanks to ``@brutus``
  and Jan Willems for initial report & troubleshooting, and to Greg Back for
  identifying the fix.
* :bug:`237 major` Completion output lacked "inverse" flag names (e.g.
  ``--no-myoption`` as a boolean negative version of a defaulting-to-True
  boolean ``myoption``). This has been corrected.
* :bug:`239 major` Completion erroneously presented core flags instead of
  per-task flags when both are present in the invocation being completed (e.g.
  ``inv --debug my_task -<tab>``). This has been fixed.
* :bug:`238 major` (partial fix) Update the ``zsh`` completion script to
  account for use of the ``--collection`` core flag.
* :support:`-` Additional rearranging of ``run``/``Runner`` related concerns
  for improved subclassing, organization, and use in other libraries,
  including:

    * Changed the name of the ``runner`` module to ``runners``.
    * Moved the top level ``run`` function from its original home in
      ``invoke.runner`` to `invoke.__init__ <invoke>`, to reflect the fact that
      it's now simply a convenience wrapper around ``Runner``.
    * Tweaked the implementation of `~invoke.runners.Runner` so it can
      reference `~invoke.context.Context` objects (useful for anticipated
      subclasses).

  .. warning::
    These are backwards incompatible changes if your code was doing any imports
    from the ``invoke.runner`` module (including especially
    ``invoke.runner.run``, which is now only ``invoke.run``). Function
    signatures have **not** changed.

* :support:`224` Add a completion script for the ``fish`` shell, courtesy of
  Jaime Marquínez Ferrándiz.
* :release:`0.10.1 <2015-03-17>`
* :support:`- backported` Tweak README to reflect recent(-ish) changes in
  ``pip`` re: users who install the development version via ``pip`` instead of
  using git.
* :release:`0.10.0 <2015-03-17>`
* :feature:`104` Add core CLI flag ``--complete`` to support shell tab
  completion scripts, and add some 'blessed' such scripts for bash (3 and 4)
  and zsh. Thanks to Ivan Malison and Andrew Roberts for providing discussion &
  early patchsets.
* :support:`-` Reorganize `~invoke.runners.Runner`, `~invoke.runners.Local` and
  ``invoke.runner.run`` for improved distribution of responsibilities &
  downstream subclassing.

  .. warning::
    This includes backwards incompatible changes to the API signature of most
    members of the ``invoke.runner`` module, including ``invoke.runner.run``.
    (However, in the case of ``invoke.runner.run``, the changes are mostly in
    the later, optional keyword arguments.)

* :feature:`219` Fall back to non-PTY command execution in situations where
  ``pty=True`` but no PTY appears present. See `~invoke.runners.Local` for
  details.
* :support:`212` Implement basic linting support using ``flake8``, and apply
  formatting changes to satisfy said linting. As part of this shakeup, also
  changed all old-style (``%s``) string formatting to new-style (``{0}``).
  Thanks to Collin Anderson for the foundational patch.
* :support:`215` (also :issue:`213`, :issue:`214`) Tweak tests & configuration
  sections of the code to include Windows compatibility. Thanks to Paul Moore.
* :bug:`201 major` (also :issue:`211`) Replace the old, first-draft gross
  monkeypatched Popen code used for ``invoke.runner.run`` with a
  non-monkeypatched approach that works better on non-POSIX platforms like
  Windows, and also attempts to handle encoding and locale issues more
  gracefully (meaning: at all gracefully).

  Specifically, the new approach uses threading instead of ``select.select``,
  and performs explicit encoding/decoding based on detected or explicitly
  expressed encodings.

  Major thanks to Paul Moore for an enormous amount of
  testing/experimentation/discussion, as well as the bulk of the code changes
  themselves.

  .. warning::
    The top level ``invoke.runner.run`` function has had a minor signature
    change: the sixth positional argument used to be ``runner`` and is now
    ``encoding`` (with ``runner`` now being the seventh positional argument).

* :feature:`147` Drastically overhaul/expand the configuration system to
  account for multiple configuration levels including (but not limited to) file
  paths, environment variables, and Python-level constructs (previously the
  only option). See :ref:`configuration` for details. Thanks to Erich Heine for
  his copious feedback on this topic.

  .. warning::
    This is technically a backwards incompatible change, though some existing
    user config-setting code may continue to work as-is. In addition, this
    system may see further updates before 1.0.

* :bug:`191 major` Bypass ``pexpect``'s automatic command splitting to avoid
  issues running complex nested/quoted commands under a pty. Credit to
  ``@mijikai`` for noticing the problem.
* :bug:`183 major` Task docstrings whose first line started on the same line as
  the opening quote(s) were incorrectly presented in ``invoke --help <task>``.
  This has been fixed by using `inspect.getdoc`. Thanks to Pekka Klärck for the
  catch & suggested fix.
* :bug:`180 major` Empty invocation (e.g. just ``invoke`` with no flags or
  tasks, and when no default task is defined) no longer printed help output,
  instead complaining about the lack of default task. It now prints help again.
  Thanks to Brent O'Connor for the catch.
* :bug:`175 major` ``autoprint`` did not function correctly for tasks stored
  in sub-collections; this has been fixed. Credit: Matthias Lehmann.
* :release:`0.9.0 <2014-08-26>`
* :bug:`165 major` Running ``inv[oke]`` with no task names on a collection
  containing a default task should (intuitively) have run that default task,
  but instead did nothing. This has been fixed.
* :bug:`167 major` Running the same task multiple times in one CLI session was
  horribly broken; it works now. Thanks to Erich Heine for the report.
* :bug:`119 major` (also :issue:`162`, :issue:`113`) Better handle
  platform-sensitive operations such as pty size detection or use, either
  replacing with platform-specific implementations or raising useful
  exceptions. Thanks to Gabi Davar and (especially) Paul Moore, for feedback &
  original versions of the final patchset.
* :feature:`136` Added the ``autoprint`` flag to
  `invoke.tasks.Task`/`@task <invoke.tasks.task>`, allowing users to set up
  tasks which act as both subroutines & "print a result" CLI tasks. Thanks to
  Matthias Lehmann for the original patch.
* :bug:`162 major` Adjust platform-sensitive imports so Windows users don't
  encounter import-time exceptions. Thanks to Paul Moore for the patch.
* :support:`169` Overhaul the Sphinx docs into two trees, one for main project
  info and one for versioned API docs.
* :bug:`- major` Fixed a sub-case of the already-mostly-fixed :issue:`149` so
  the error message works usefully even with no explicit collection name given.
* :release:`0.8.2 <2014-06-15>`
* :bug:`149` Print a useful message to stderr when Invoke can't find the
  requested collection/tasks file, instead of displaying a traceback.
* :bug:`145` Ensure a useful message is displayed (instead of a confusing
  exception) when listing empty task collections.
* :bug:`142` The refactored Loader class failed to account for the behavior of
  `imp.find_module` when run against packages (vs modules) and was exploding at
  load time. This has been fixed. Thanks to David Baumgold for catch & patch.
* :release:`0.8.1 <2014-06-09>`
* :bug:`140` Revert incorrect changes to our ``setup.py`` regarding detection
  of sub-packages such as the vendor tree & the parser. Also add additional
  scripting to our Travis-CI config to catch this class of error in future.
  Thanks to Steven Loria and James Cox for the reports.
* :release:`0.8.0 <2014-06-08>`
* :feature:`135` (also bugs :issue:`120`, :issue:`123`) Implement post-tasks to
  match pre-tasks, and allow control over the arguments passed to both (via
  `invoke.tasks.call`). For details, see :ref:`pre-post-tasks`.

  .. warning::
      Pre-tasks were overhauled a moderate amount to implement this feature;
      they now require references to **task objects** instead of **task
      names**. This is a backwards incompatible change.

* :support:`25` Trim a bunch of time off the test suite by using mocking and
  other tools instead of dogfooding a bunch of subprocess spawns.
* :bug:`128 major` Positional arguments containing underscores were not
  exporting to the parser correctly; this has been fixed. Thanks to J. Javier
  Maestro for catch & patch.
* :bug:`121 major` Add missing help output denoting inverse Boolean options
  (i.e. ``--[no-]foo`` for a ``--foo`` flag whose value defaults to true.)
  Thanks to Andrew Roberts for catch & patch.
* :support:`118` Update the bundled ``six`` plus other minor tweaks to support
  files. Thanks to Matt Iversen.
* :feature:`115` Make it easier to reuse Invoke's primary CLI machinery in
  other (non-Invoke-distributed) bin-scripts. Thanks to Noah Kantrowitz.
* :feature:`110` Add task docstrings' 1st lines to ``--list`` output. Thanks to
  Hiroki Kiyohara for the original PR (with assists from Robert Read and James
  Thigpen.)
* :support:`117` Tidy up ``setup.py`` a bit, including axing the (broken)
  `distutils` support. Thanks to Matt Iversen for the original PR & followup
  discussion.
* :feature:`87` (also :issue:`92`) Rework the loader module such that recursive
  filesystem searching is implemented, and is used instead of searching
  `sys.path`.
  
  This adds the behavior most users expect or are familiar with from Fabric 1
  or similar tools; and it avoids nasty surprise collisions with other
  installed packages containing files named ``tasks.py``.

  Thanks to Michael Hahn for the original report & PR, and to Matt Iversen for
  providing the discovery algorithm used in the final version of this change.

  .. warning::
      This is technically a backwards incompatible change (reminder: we're not
      at 1.0 yet!). You'll only notice if you were relying on adding your tasks
      module to ``sys.path`` and then calling Invoke elsewhere on the
      filesystem.

* :support:`-` Refactor the `invoke.runners.Runner` module to differentiate
  what it means to run a command in the abstract, from execution specifics. Top
  level API is unaffected.
* :bug:`131 major` Make sure one's local tasks module is always first in
  ``sys.path``, even if its parent directory was already somewhere else in
  ``sys.path``. This ensures that local tasks modules never become hidden by
  third-party ones. Thanks to ``@crccheck`` for the early report and to Dorian
  Puła for assistance fixing.
* :bug:`116 major` Ensure nested config overrides play nicely with default
  tasks and pre-tasks.
* :bug:`127 major` Fill in tasks' exposed ``name`` attribute with body name if
  explicit name not given.
* :feature:`124` Add a ``--debug`` flag to the core parser to enable easier
  debugging (on top of existing ``INVOKE_DEBUG`` env var.)
* :feature:`125` Improve output of Failure exceptions when printed.
* :release:`0.7.0 <2014.01.28>`
* :feature:`109` Add a ``default`` kwarg to
  `invoke.collection.Collection.add_task` allowing per-collection control over
  default tasks.
* :feature:`108` Update `invoke.collection.Collection.from_module` to accept
  useful shorthand arguments for tweaking the `invoke.collection.Collection`
  objects it creates (e.g. name, configuration.)
* :feature:`107` Update configuration merging behavior for more flexible reuse
  of imported task modules, such as parameterizing multiple copies of a module
  within a task tree.
* :release:`0.6.1 <2013.11.21>`
* :bug:`96` Tasks in subcollections which set explicit names (via e.g.
  ``@task(name='foo')``) were not having those names honored. This is fixed.
  Thanks to Omer Katz for the report.
* :bug:`98` **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE!** Configuration merging has been
  reversed so outer collections' config settings override inner collections.
  This makes distributing reusable modules significantly less silly.
* :release:`0.6.0 <2013.11.21>`
* :bug:`86 major` Task arguments named with an underscore broke the help feature;
  this is now fixed. Thanks to Stéphane Klein for the catch.
* :feature:`89` Implemented configuration for distributed task modules: can set
  config options in `invoke.collection.Collection` objects and they are made
  available to contextualized tasks.
* :release:`0.5.1 <2013.09.15>`
* :bug:`81` Fall back to sane defaults for PTY sizes when autodetection gives
  insane results. Thanks to ``@akitada`` for the patch.
* :bug:`83` Fix a bug preventing underscored keyword arguments from working
  correctly as CLI flags (e.g. ``mytask --my-arg`` would not map back correctly
  to ``mytask(my_arg=...)``.) Credit: ``@akitada``.
* :release:`0.5.0 <2013.08.16>`
* :feature:`57` Optional-value flags added - e.g. ``--foo`` tells the parser to
  set the ``foo`` option value to True; ``--foo myval`` sets the value to
  "myval". The built-in ``--help`` option now leverages this feature for
  per-task help (e.g. ``--help`` displays global help, ``--help mytask``
  displays help for ``mytask`` only.)
* :bug:`55 major` A bug in our vendored copy of ``pexpect`` clashed with a
  Python 2->3 change in import behavior to prevent Invoke from running on
  Python 3 unless the ``six`` module was installed in one's environment. This
  was fixed - our vendored ``pexpect`` now always loads its sibling vendored
  ``six`` correctly.
