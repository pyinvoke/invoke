=========================
Using Invoke as a library
=========================

While most of its documentation involves the user/CLI facing use cases of task
management and command execution, Invoke was designed for its constituent parts
to be usable independently by advanced users - either out of the box or with a
minimum of extra work. CLI parsing, subprocess command execution, task
organization, etc, are all written as broadly separated concerns.

This document outlines use cases already known to work (because downstream
tools like `Fabric <http://fabfile.org>`_ are already utilizing them).


.. _reusing-as-a-binary:

Reusing Invoke's CLI module as a distinct binary
================================================

A major use case is distribution of your own program using Invoke under the
hood, bound to a different binary name, and usually setting a specific task
:doc:`namespace </concepts/namespaces>` as the default. (This maps somewhat
closely to things like ``argparse`` from the standard library.) In some cases,
removing, replacing and/or adding core CLI flags is also desired.

Getting set up
--------------

Say you want to distribute a test runner called ``tester`` offering two
subcommands, ``unit`` and ``integration``, such that users could ``pip install
tester`` and have access to commands like ``tester unit``, ``tester
integration``, or ``tester integration --fail-fast``.

First, as with any distinct Python package providing CLI
'binaries', you'd inform your ``setup.py`` of your entrypoint::

    setup(
        name='tester',
        version='0.1.0',
        packages=['tester'],
        install_requires=['invoke'],
        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': ['tester = tester.main:program.run']
        }
    )

.. note::
    This is just an example snippet and is not a fully valid ``setup.py``; if
    you don't know how Python packaging works, a good starting place is `the
    Python Packaging User's Guide
    <https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Nothing here is specific to Invoke - it's a standard way of telling Python to
install a ``tester`` script that executes the ``run`` method of a ``program``
object defined inside the module ``tester.main``.

Creating a ``Program``
----------------------

In our ``tester/main.py``, we start out importing Invoke's public CLI
functionality::

    from invoke import Program

Then we define the ``program`` object we referenced in ``setup.py``, which is a
simple `.Program` to do the heavy lifting, giving it our version number for
starters::

    program = Program(version='0.1.0')

At this point, installing ``tester`` would give you the same functionality as
Invoke's :doc:`built-in CLI tool </cli>`, except named ``tester`` and exposing
its own version number::

    $ tester --version
    Tester 0.1.0
    $ tester --help
    Usage: tester [--core-opts] task1 [--task1-opts] ... taskN [--taskN-opts]

    Core options:
        ... core Invoke options here ... 

    $ tester --list
    Can't find any collection named 'tasks'!

This doesn't do us much good yet - there aren't any subcommands (and our users
don't care about arbitrary 'tasks', so Invoke's own default ``--help`` and
``--list`` output isn't a good fit).

Specifying subcommands
----------------------

For ``tester`` to expose ``unit`` and ``integration`` subcommands, we need to
define them, in a regular Invoke tasks module or :doc:`namespace
</concepts/namespaces>`. For our example, we'll just create ``tester/tasks.py``
(but as you'll see in a moment, this too is arbitrary and can be whatever you
like)::

    from invoke import task

    @task
    def unit(ctx):
        print("Running unit tests!")

    @task
    def integration(ctx):
        print("Running integration tests!")

As described in :doc:`/concepts/namespaces`, you can arrange this module
however you want - the above snippet uses an implicit namespace for brevity's
sake.

.. note::
    It's important to realize that there's nothing special about these
    "subcommands" - you could run them just as easily with vanilla Invoke,
    e.g. via ``invoke --collection=tester.tasks --list``.

Now the useful part: telling our custom `.Program` that this namespace of tasks
should be used as the subcommands for ``tester``, via the ``namespace`` kwarg::

    from invoke import Collection, Program
    from tester import tasks

    program = Program(namespace=Collection.from_module(tasks), version='0.1.0')

The result?

::

    $ tester --version
    Tester 0.1.0
    $ tester --help
    Usage: tester [--core-opts] <subcommand> [--subcommand-opts] ...

    Core options:
      ... core options here, minus task-related ones ...

    Subcommands:
      unit
      integration

    $ tester --list
    No idea what '--list' is!
    $ tester unit
    Running unit tests!

Notice how the 'usage' line changed (to specify 'subcommands' instead of
'tasks'); the list of specific subcommands is now printed as part of
``--help``; and ``--list`` has been removed from the options.

You can enable :ref:`tab-completion<tab-completion>` for your distinct
binary and subcommands. 


Modifying core parser arguments
-------------------------------

A common need for this use case is tweaking the core parser arguments.
`.Program` makes it easy: default core `Arguments <.Argument>` are returned by
`.Program.core_args`. Extend this method's return value with ``super`` and
you're done::

    # Presumably, this is your setup.py-designated CLI module...

    from invoke import Program, Argument

    class MyProgram(Program):
        def core_args(self):
            core_args = super(MyProgram, self).core_args()
            extra_args = [
                Argument(names=('foo', 'f'), help="Foo the bars"),
                # ...
            ]
            return core_args + extra_args

    program = MyProgram()

.. warning::
    We don't recommend *omitting* any of the existing core arguments; a lot of
    basic functionality relies on their existence, even when left to default
    values.


.. _customizing-config-defaults:

Customizing the configuration system's defaults
===============================================

Besides the CLI-oriented content of the previous section, another area of
functionality that frequently needs updating when redistributing an Invoke
codebase (CLI or no CLI) is configuration. There are typically two concerns
here:

- Configuration filenames and the env var prefix - crucial if you ever expect
  your users to use the configuration system;
- Default configuration values - less critical (most defaults aren't labeled
  with anything Invoke-specific) but still sometimes desirable.

Both of these involve subclassing `.Config` (and, if using the CLI machinery,
informing your `.Program` to use that subclass instead of the default one.)

Changing filenames and/or env var prefix
----------------------------------------

By default, Invoke's config system looks for files like ``/etc/invoke.yaml``,
``~/.invoke.json``, etc. If you're distributing client code named something
else, like the ``Tester`` example earlier, you might instead want the config
system to load ``/etc/tester.json`` or ``$CWD/tester.py``.

Similarly, the environment variable config level looks for env vars like
``INVOKE_RUN_ECHO``; you might prefer ``TESTER_RUN_ECHO``.

There are a few `.Config` attributes controlling these values:

- ``prefix``: A generic, catchall prefix used directly as the file prefix, and
  used via all-caps as the env var prefix;
- ``file_prefix``: For overriding just the filename prefix - otherwise, it
  defaults to the value of ``prefix``;
- ``env_prefix``: For overriding just the env var prefix - as you might have
  guessed, it too defaults to the value of ``prefix``.

Continuing our 'Tester' example, you'd do something like this::

    from invoke import Config

    class TesterConfig(Config):
        prefix = 'tester'

Or, to seek ``tester.yaml`` as before, but ``TEST_RUN_ECHO`` instead of
``TESTER_RUN_ECHO``::

    class TesterConfig(Config):
        prefix = 'tester'
        env_prefix = 'TEST'

Modifying default config values
-------------------------------

Default config values are simple - they're just the return value of the
staticmethod `.Config.global_defaults`, so override that and return whatever
you like - ideally something based on the superclass' values, as many defaults
are assumed to exist by the rest of the system. (The helper function
`invoke.config.merge_dicts` can be useful here.)

For example, say you want Tester to always echo shell commands by default when
your codebase calls `.Context.run`::

    from invoke.config import Config, merge_dicts

    class TesterConfig(Config):
        @staticmethod
        def global_defaults():
            their_defaults = Config.global_defaults()
            my_defaults = {
                'run': {
                    'echo': True,
                },
            }
            return merge_dicts(their_defaults, my_defaults)

For reference, Invoke's own base defaults (the...default defaults, you could
say) are documented at :ref:`default-values`.
